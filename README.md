# Inherited digital divide.

The collateral effects of the Corona crisis have made more notorious how the digital divide is still impacting today’s society, especially how people from a disadvantaged position in the society are left out of the benefits the internet can offer. In this research, we have studied how the digital divide is still impacting on a developing country like Mexico. 
Digital divide studies have mostly focused on the understanding of this problem through the user’s characteristics. Previous works that have studied the influence of parents on the digital divide have not consistently addressed the effect of parent’s education on the activities that have the potential to bring benefits in different spheres of the user’s life.
Thus, we investigated the inheritance parent’s education has on the digital divide for the users (the offspring of the parents). We examined the involvement of users into activities that have the potential to bring benefits to the Human and Social Capital. This means getting more knowledge (Human capital) and mobilizing resources among the user’s networks (Social Capital) through the type of activities users enroll online. 

We tested the hypothesis from the Master Thesis "Inherited Digital Divide" using two mediation models, the codes can be found on the Mediation Analysis.do files and by using the software Stata 16 (StataCorp, 2019). The dataset used is the one contained in the .dta file, which was originally taken from SCT (2018).

We found that the parents’ education itself slightly and directly impacts the activities in which the offspring are partaking online. However, parents’ educational influence goes mostly through the ICT equipment, the user’s education, and negatively on the user’s internet skills. Moreover, the enrollment on these types of activities is predicted mostly by the user’s education and their internet skills, although the variety of ICT equipment was also a relevant factor determining how much users partake in such activities.
As a result of these relationships between user’s characteristics and the influence that parent’s education has, offspring’s from less educated families are profiting less from the internet when they are compared with their peers in a more favored position in society. Beyond the user’s own characteristics, their parents had already influenced what their offspring can do online.
